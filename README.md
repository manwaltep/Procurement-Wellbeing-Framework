# Procurement-Wellbeing-Framework
The **Procurement Wellbeing Framework** is a journey of redefining value in procurement embracing social, economic, environmental, and cultural elements. Evaluating the impact and outcomes in these dimensions expands the concept of value, allowing procurement to become more aligned with other wellbeing frameworks and value systems. Procurement has inextricably been intertwined with concepts of Time, Cost, and Quality, which may be important, but they dont capture the comprehensive nature of Procurement and, arguably, what procurements true capabilities are when considered holistically.
