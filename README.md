# Procurement-Wellbeing-Framework
Welcome to the **Procurement Wellbeing Framework** a journey of redefining the structures of value in procurement. As we embark on this expedition, our compass is guided by a set of fundamental axioms and derivative principles. These axioms, forming the bedrock of our framework, are straightforward yet profound: "Suffering is bad", "Prosperity is good", "Understanding is good".

Informed by these axioms, derivative principles take shape, manifesting through the pillars of social, economic, environmental, and cultural dimensions. Our focus is to evaluate and enrich the impact and outcomes in these areas, thereby broadening the definition of value. This shift allows procurement to align more closely with various wellbeing frameworks and value systems.

Procurement, historically bound by the constructs of Time, Cost, and Quality, is on the cusp of breaking free from these constraints. While these factors retain their relevance, they no longer suffice in capturing the comprehensive and multifaceted nature of Procurement. As we stand on the brink of a new era, we recognise that procurement is inherently dynamic, and its full potential is only beginning to unfold.

Our ambition with this framework is to redefine the foundations of Procurement today, proactively anticipating change tomorrow, built with a vision of **timeless values**. This implies delving deeper within existing wisdoms while extending far beyond traditional boundaries. We hope to inspire and challenge current norms but to usher in an approach to procurement that is not just transactional, but transformational. Join us on this journey as we reimagine procurement, creating a brighter future for all.

# Preface

We are standing at the precipice of a new era. An era marked by the interplay of technology and humanity, complex global networks, and an urgent call for sustainable and equitable systems. In this context, the traditional models of procurement - once confined to the pillars of Time, Cost, and Quality - demand a transformative shift. A shift that not only embraces but thrives in the face of these evolving complexities.

Procurement, a function with far-reaching impacts on our social, economic, environmental, and cultural fabric, needs to move beyond its conventional boundaries. It must be seen not just as a business process, but as a powerful tool for change, a catalyst for value creation that aligns with the greater well-being of all stakeholders.

In this light, the **Procurement Wellbeing Framework** presents a bold and pioneering approach to procurement. This approach doesn't merely adjust the existing models. Instead, it reimagines procurement from the ground up, grounded in axioms, the ethos of a decentralised, self-organising and modular, and dynamic system.

This framework draws inspiration from nature's wisdom, where leaderless ecosystems thrive in harmony, powered by the principles of autonomy, interconnection, and adaptability. It aims to kindle a grassroots movement in procurement, one that values consensus over compliance, alignment over control, and shared purpose over isolated success.

As we embark on this journey of redefining value in procurement, we extend an invitation to all - individuals, organisations, and networks engaged in procurement. Let us come together to embrace this dynamic change, to learn, innovate, and shape a procurement function that genuinely aligns with the well-being of our societies, economies, environment, and cultural heritage.

In the following sections, we delve into the key components of the Procurement Wellbeing Framework. Each component is a testament to our shared vision of a more inclusive, sustainable, and value-centric approach to procurement. We hope this framework sparks conversations, encourages experimentation, and serves as a guidepost for those committed to transforming procurement's potential into a tangible reality.
